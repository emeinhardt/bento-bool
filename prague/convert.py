'''
Module to take
 - a tab-separated value file specifying a binary or ternary feature matrix.
   - the file is assumed to have a header row indicating feature labels
   - each non-header row represents an object's feature vector
   - features are assumed to be {`+`,`-`,`0`} (following phonological
     convention) by default
 - a (potentially -- comma-separated -- list of) column name(s) indicating any
   columns not containing feature-value information (e.g. an object's label =
  IPA symbol in the case of phonological feature matrices).

and write
 - the ordered list of feature names (reflecting the ordering in the input
   `.tsv`) to a `.txt` file
 - a serialized numpy ndarray `.npy` file representing the unique feature
   vectors of the `.tsv` file as a matrix, with each row corresponding to
   an object and feature values represented as `1`, `-1`, or `0`
 - a tab-separated-value file with `+` replaced with `1` and `-` replaced with
   `-1`.

Note that if your feature matrix contains multiple objects that have the same
featural description, this notebook will detect and record as much, but the
final matrix it produces will only have one row for each unique feature vector.
