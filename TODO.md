# Todo

## Tests

 - Add more unit tests for `feature_vector.py` functions.
 - Add unit tests as multiple implementations of a given function are added.
 
## Project structure

 - update readme.
 - `requirements` file.
 - add license.

## Implementation / performance features

 - Add support for joblib from existing code.
 - Add support for pyspark and a library (e.g. TileDB) that will efficiently 
   support concurrent reads/writes.
 - Add support for pytorch + gpus from existing code.
 - Add support for more memory safe implementations from existing code.
 

## Other features / interface

 - Better support for creating and being able to use an association between
   symbols (or object dictionaries) and associated ternary ndarray feature vectors.
 - Add support for parsing conventional feature vector strings to feature dictionaries.
 - Add CLI support.
 - Add default support/nice integration with `PanPhon`-exportable data
   structures.
